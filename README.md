# Vim
My Vim and ZSH settings with the plugins I use everyday. Feel free to try them!

## Read Me in construction

To install the Oh-My-Zsh run
<code>sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"</code>
Copy the .zshrc file to your root dir and reset the terminal.

To install de Vim Plugins, copy the file .vimrc to your root dir.

Then open .vimrc and press <code>Ctrl + a</code>.

After that, run <code>:PluginInstall</code>.

Then Reset save the changes and exit vim.

The Auto-complete and the Icons for NEERTree need a bit more of work, just follow this instructions:

Auto-complete: https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#linux-64-bit

Icons: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation

Next time you open vim, the plugins will all be instaled! Enjoy!
